Here is the code of the React challenge. Although I must admit the real challenge was to decide how complex to make a simple ask. Considering I don't have much React on my résumé, I thought it was important to show I could handle multiple components. This app is currently built and deployed at https://changeisnow.netlify.app for your viewing and interacting pleasure. For the record, I was going to integrate drag-and-drop for the items, but I felt like I had maybe already put too much time into things, and one of the key marks of a good senior developer is knowing when it's time to consider the job completed. Thank you for looking at my code, and I promise you my commit messages are much better for business than these are.
